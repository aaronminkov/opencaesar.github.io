## Project Summary

Our project aims to provide engineers with a web-based, user-friendly application that will circumvent the need to learn the OML language in its entirety while still allowing users to benefit from its systems modeling capacity.

Our primary objective this summer is to transition the existing eclipse-based application, CAESAR Workbench, into a web-based Visual Studio (VS) Code extension. This summer’s goal is to produce a cost estimate for the complete implementation while concurrently striving to complete the application. We will focus on designing a comprehensive user interface (UI) that streamlines the use of the OML language. This interface will query data to and from a backend API via a service layer, separate from the frontend VS Code plugin. Beyond simply reimplementing the existing application's functionality, we aim to find ways to improve the presentation of information via a tabular UI and form-based UI subviews.

Ultimately, our project seeks to reimagine how engineers interact with the OML language by abstracting its complexities behind a more accessible and user-friendly web-based interface. We believe this approach will empower engineers to effectively utilize the robust capabilities of OML for systems modeling without needing to master every detail of the language. By enhancing the user experience, we aim to convince our team’s customers and sponsors to fund the completion and broader adoption of the tool.
